Processing	http://processing.org	Processing is an open source programming language and environment for people who want to create images, animations, and interactions. It was founded by Ben Fry and Casey Reas in 2001 while both were students under John Maeda at the MIT Media Lab. In recent years it has evolved into one of the most significant and versatile visual programming languages in the visualisation field, particularly off the back of Fry’s excellent Visualizing Data book about computational information design which extensively described the potential power of the Processing environment. Today, there are tens of thousands of students, artists, designers, researchers, and hobbyists who use Processing for learning, prototyping, and production.	2	0.70208333333333	Casey Reas, Ben Fry	Java
Protovis	http://vis.stanford.edu/protovis/	Protovis is an emerging free and open-source JavaScript based visualisation project, led by Mike Bostock and Jeff Heer of the Stanford Visualization Group, which composes custom views of data with simple marks such as bars and dots. Unlike low-level graphics libraries that quickly become tedious for visualisation, Protovis defines marks through dynamic properties that encode data, allowing inheritance, scales and layouts to simplify construction. It uses JavaScript and SVG for web-native visualisations which means no plugins are required.	2	0.045833333333333	Mike Bostock	Javascript, SVG
Many Eyes	http://many-eyes.com	Data visualisation tools from IBM. The app allows users to upload data and then produce graphic representations for others to view and comment upon.	1	0.16583333333333	IBM	Java
Prefuse Flare	http://flare.prefuse.org	The Prefuse Flare toolkit is a successor to Prefuse and provides visualisation and animation tools for ActionScript and the Adobe Flash Player. From basic charts and graphs to complex interactive graphics, the toolkit supports data management, visual encoding, animation, and interaction techniques. Moreover, flare features a modular design that lets developers create customized visualization techniques without having to reinvent the wheel.	3	0.043333333333333	Jeff Heer	Flash
D3	http://mbostock.github.com/d3/	D3 is a fresh and efficient visualisation framework created by one of the Protovis creators, Mike Bostock. Its key feature is that it allows you to bind data to a Document Object Model (DOM) and then apply smooth data-driven transformations and interactions to the document. D3′s lightweight characteristics enables it to expose the full capabilities of underlying technologies such as CSS3, HTML5 and SVG. Accordingly D3 is extremely fast, supports large datasets and overall provides great flexibility in designing a contemporary web-based visualisation.	3	0.025208333333333	Mike Bostock	Javascript, SVG

Processing.js	http://processingjs.org/	Processing.js is a ‘port’ of Processing, a sister project as it were, designed to make data visualisations, digital art, interactive animations, educational graphs, video games, etc. work using web standards and without any plug-ins. You write code using the Processing language, include it in a web page, and Processing.js does the rest. Whether you’re an advanced Processing developer or completely new, whether you’re a pro with web technologies or just getting started, Processing.js bridges the gap between these two powerful technologies.	2	0.06	John Resig	Javascript, canvas
Raphael	http://raphaeljs.com/	Raphaël is a small JavaScript library that should simplify your work with vector graphics on the web. If you want to create your own specific chart or image crop and rotate widget, for example, you can achieve it simply and easily with this library. Raphaël uses the SVG W3C Recommendation and VML as a base for creating graphics. This means every graphical object you create is also a DOM object, so you can attach JavaScript event handlers or modify them later. Raphaël’s goal is to provide an adapter that will make drawing vector art compatible cross-browser and easy.	2	0.0925	Sencha	Javascript, canvas
Degrafa	http://www.degrafa.org/	The focus behind the Declarative Graphics Framework (Degrafa) is to bring the graphics classes up a level to provide a common ground between developer and designer within Flex, and enable the graphics classes to become first class citizens within the Flex framework.	3	0.037083333333333	Jason Hawryluk, Juan Sanchez	Flash
Mapnik	http://mapnik.org/	Mapnik is a Free Toolkit for developing mapping applications. Above all Mapnik is about making beautiful maps. It is easily extensible and suitable for both desktop and web development.	2	0.033541666666667	Artem Pavlenko	C++, Python	LGPL

OpenLayers	http://openlayers.org/	OpenLayers makes it easy to put a dynamic map in any web page. It can display map tiles and markers loaded from any source.	2	0.10958333333333		Javascript	Clear BSD
Mapstraction	http://mapstraction.com	Mapstraction is a library that provides a common API for various javascript mapping APIs to enable switching from one to another as smoothly as possible. Developers can code their applications once, and then easily switch mapping provider based on project needs, terms and conditions, and new functionality.	2	0.03375		Javascript
MapBox	http://mapbox.com/	MapBox hosts free custom designed map tiles, detailed documentation to help you add these tiles to your website, and open source tools for power users to make their own map tiles.	2	0.013125	Development Seed	Various
NodeBox	http://nodebox.net	NodeBox allows you to create visual output with programming code. The application targets an audience of designers, with an easy set of state commands that is both intuitive and creative.

R	http://www.r-project.org/	R is a highly extensible, open source language and environment for data handling, statistical computing and graphical techniques. One of R’s key strengths is the ease with which well-designed publication-quality graphical plots can be produced. Importantly, from a good practice principles perspective, great care has been taken over the defaults for the minor design choices in graphics whilst allowing the user to retain full control beyond. Many people traditionally think of R as a statistics system but its power and potential as a visualisation tool is significant and its popularity within the field is growing constantly.	2	1	R Foundation	R
Prefuse	http://prefuse.org/	Prefuse is a Java programming framework for creating rich interactive data visualisations supporting a rich set of features for data modeling, visualisation, and interaction. It provides optimised data structures for tables, graphs, and trees, a host of layout and visual encoding techniques, and support for animation, dynamic queries, integrated search, and database connectivity. Prefuse is written in Java, using the Java 2D graphics library, and is easily integrated into Java Swing applications or web applets.	3	0.035		Java
